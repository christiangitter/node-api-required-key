# Node API with required body information

## Intention
In some cases it can be usefull to present data only with a specific body information.<br> This example shows how to do that. I created an example which is showing data only if a specific `key` is provided. <br>
The key will be stored in a `.env` file. This file is not part of this repository. You have to create it by yourself. <br>
You can demand what ever you want.

## Pre-requisites

### Install Packages

1. express -> `npm i express`
2. body-parser -> `npm i body-parser`
3. .env -> `npm i dotenv`
